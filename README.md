# Bottle_Synthetic_Images
## Introduction
In Germany, great importance is given to recycling bottles, which is why there are recycling kiosks all over the cities. Currently, the manual process appears to be time-consuming. With the help of this pipeline, the processing time and maintenance needed will be reduced.

Dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/bottle-synthetic-images-dataset/data

*Note that:* To be able to do the best practice, the number of the images per label reduced to 3000. Thus, the model trained with total number of 15000 images.

Dataset consist of five labels:
1.   Plastic Bottles
2.   Beer Bottles
3.   Soda Bottles
4.   Water Bottles
5.   Wine Bottles
